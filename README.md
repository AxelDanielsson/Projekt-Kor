Run main.py to create summary for each day using FA data using functions in milk_functions.py. summary.py is for plotting summary data from many days. It is best to import functions to main.py if you are unable to run summary.py in sections. If days other than we worked on is to be used, the merging of cowinfo and summary files would probably need to be changed in week_summary().
